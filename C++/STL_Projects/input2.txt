There      is no  pain ,you are   receding
A distantship  ,smoke onthehorizon  .
You  are only coming through in waves .
Your lips move but I can't hear
what    you're    saying   .
When  I  was  a  child , I  had
a       fever    !
My hands felt just like twoballoons  .
Now I've got that feeling
once    again
I can't explain you
would not understand
This is not how I am.
I have become comfortably numb
