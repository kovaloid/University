There I was    completely wasting
	Out of    work and     down
All inside it's so frustrating
	As I    drift from town to town
Feel as    though   nobody    cares
If I      live or      die
So I   might as  1 well begin
To put some     action in my     life
So much for the golden future
I      can't    even      start
I've had every promise broken
And there's anger in my     heart
	You don't know what it's like
You don't have a clue
	If you did you'd find yourselves
Do the same thing too
